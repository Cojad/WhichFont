WhichFont
========

WhichFont is a script that detects which font in the stack is being used on any elements of a web page.

This is a forked version of: https://github.com/chengyin/WhatFont-Bookmarklet
The main difference with this version is the inclusive nature of the css within the script (compared with fetching a .css file from chengyin's server). This allows the script to be executed without issues on HTTPS domains.

How to Use
----------
Copy the contents of WhichFont.min.js as the 'href' to a new bookmark.
